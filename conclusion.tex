\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we introduce our great effort to realize ultra large scale performance-aware traffic management from the perspective of cloud providers. The modern TE represents a 1000× increase in traffic volume and a 100× increase in network size compared to SWAN a decade ago. We still use router agents on WAN routers which run on multiple firmware operating systems, but have modified them to deal with greater scale and functionality. {\sys} marks the progression of SDN into an Internet backbone. It is driven by scaling our backbone to serve today’s users. We continue to expand the roles and functionality of {\sys} to address the growth of network demands.

We consider the following perspectives to reduce the running time of the algorithms at the time slot level. The effect of each optimization is summarised in Figure \ref{fig:OptEffect}.
