\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we introduce our effort to realize ultra large scale performance-aware traffic management from the perspective of cloud providers. It is driven by considering the cost of backbone transmission to serve the deiverse demands of todayâ€™s users. We consider the following perspectives to reduce the running time of the algorithms at the time slot level. We decompose the complex linear programming problem at the time slot level into a simple exit topping decision linear programming problem and a heuristic scheduling problem. This allows {\sys} for good scalability. For the goal of scheduling 200 million flows per time slot, the algorithm runtime has gone from being almost unsolvable to completing the scheduling in about 1 hour. In addition, we drastically reduce the flows we are concerned about in heuristic scheduling by observing the characteristics of the flows and setting the hyperparameter $FT$ to filter the non-performance-aware flows. This further reduces the scheduling time to O(1min). Finally, we give the network slicing scheme. Under our slicewise parallel tests, the network slice scheme enables the scheduling of 200 million flows to be completed in less than 10 seconds.
